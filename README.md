# hey, it's yuliya! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Web Developer with a background in Quality Assurance.

In fall of 2020 I have decided to step out of my comfort zone and challenge myself to become a Web Developer. After 17 weeks of sleepless nights, drinking coffee at 7pm and late night zoom pairing sessions with my classmates, I have graduated from Software Engineering program at Fullstack Academy.

Outside of coding I enjoy [street photography](https://www.instagram.com/yuliyastreet/), making [AR effects for Instagram](https://www.facebook.com/sparkarhub/portfolios/fb/juliakondr1/), painting and rock climbing.
